# Debiaser Beware (public repo)
Repository containing Google Colab code for ["Debiaser Beware: Pitfalls of Centering Regularized Transport Maps"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08919.pdf) (ICML 2022); this is joint work with Jonathan Niles-Weed, and Marco Cuturi.

Code should work out of the box. We recommend using colab with GPU enabled, otherwise the runtime becomes quite slow for large sample sizes.

Our code is based off the following [repository](https://gitlab.com/proussillon/wasserstein-estimation-sinkhorn-divergence) for the paper ["Faster Wasserstein Distance Estimation with the Sinkhorn Divergence"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08172.pdf) by Chizat, Roussillon, Léger, Vialard, and Peyré (2020).
